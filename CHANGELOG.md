# 1.6.0

## Nanotune works without a terminal

Every command previously crashed when `stdin` wasn't a TTY. Ink enables raw mode as soon as a component calls `useInput`, so piping output, running in CI, running in Docker without `-t`, or simply redirecting stdin produced a 40-line React reconciler stack trace instead of output — even for read-only commands like `status` that never needed a keypress.

```bash
nanotune status | tee run.log     # previously: ERROR Raw mode is not supported...
```

Commands now detect whether a keyboard is available and behave accordingly.

### Render-and-exit commands
`status`, `data validate`, `train`, `export`, `benchmark`, and `judge test` render their output and exit on their own when there's no TTY, instead of parking on a "press any key" frame forever.

- **Non-zero exit codes on failure** — a failed run now sets exit code 1, so `nanotune train && nanotune export` chains correctly and CI can gate on `nanotune data validate`.
- **Keyboard hints are suppressed** when there's no keyboard, keeping captured output clean.

### Interactive-only commands
`init`, `data add`, `data list`, `chat`, and `judge configure` genuinely need a keyboard. They now print a single clear sentence and exit 1:

```
`nanotune chat` needs an interactive terminal.
stdin is not a TTY, so it cannot read keypresses. Run it directly in a
terminal rather than through a pipe, a CI job, or with stdin redirected.
```

### `nanotune data import --yes`
New `-y, --yes` flag skips the confirmation prompt, making `data import` usable from scripts and CI:

```bash
nanotune data import examples.jsonl --yes
```

Without a TTY and without `--yes`, the command explains that the flag is required rather than failing obscurely.

## Fixes

- **Platform check now fires up front.** The Apple Silicon assertion only ran inside `installLlamaCpp`, so users on Linux or Intel Macs hit a confusing `pip install mlx-lm` resolver error during `train` instead of the clear message that already existed. `train` and `export` now assert supported hardware before doing any work. Extracted to `src/lib/platform.ts`.
- **`judge.json` is written with `0600` permissions.** The file can hold a literal API key for users who don't use the `${ENV_VAR}` form. Existing configs written by earlier versions are tightened on next save.

## Documentation

- **`nanotune chat` is documented.** The 1.5.0 headline feature shipped with no docs page. Added [`docs/commands/chat.md`](docs/commands/chat.md) covering slash commands, all flags, per-turn stats, and chat-template handling, and listed it in the commands index.
- **Quick start covers `chat`** — added as step 5, between export and benchmark.
- **`data import --yes` documented** in the data command reference.
- **Fixed the benchmark preset table** — the max-tokens column read 50/100/150/200; the actual values are 128/256/512/1024.

## Internals

- **Coverage now reports an honest number.** The `c8` `exclude` pointed at `source/app/App.tsx`, a path that has never existed, and spec files were counted as covered source — trivially 100%, inflating the total. Excluding them moves the reported figure from 88.62% to 78.97% with no change in actual test coverage.
- New `src/lib/tty.ts` (raw-mode detection) and `src/lib/platform.ts` (hardware assertion), both pure and unit-tested.
- New `useKeyInput`, `useAutoExit`, and `ExitHint` in `src/components/` — `useKeyInput` is now the only sanctioned way to read keys; calling Ink's `useInput` directly reintroduces the crash.
- **239 tests total (+16)** covering raw-mode detection, platform assertions, and judge config file permissions.

## Toolchain

- Dependency updates via Dependabot: `ai` 7.0.15, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 4.0.8, `@ai-sdk/google` 4.0.8, `ink` 7.1.0, `ava` 8.0.1, `c8` 11.0.0, `knip` 6.24.0, `tsx` 4.23.0, `typescript` 6.0.3, `@types/node` 26.x, `@biomejs/biome` 2.5.1.
- Repaired a broken `pnpm-lock.yaml` and several latent toolchain breaks in CI.
- Resolved Biome config deprecations and Semgrep findings.

# 1.5.0

## `nanotune chat`

A new interactive REPL closes the loop from train → export → chat. Talk to your fine-tuned model without leaving Nanotune.

```bash
nanotune chat                # uses the latest exported GGUF
nanotune chat -m my.gguf     # specific model
nanotune chat --preset high
nanotune chat --system "You are a Bash command generator..."
```

### Features
- **Persistent `llama-server`** — model loads once, conversation reuses the same hot process. No cold start between turns.
- **Chat-template aware** — uses `/v1/chat/completions` so the GGUF's chat template is applied (ChatML, Llama-3 tags, etc.). Same wire format the model was trained on.
- **Slash commands**:
  - `/help` — show available commands
  - `/reset` (or `/clear`) — wipe conversation history
  - `/system <text>` — replace the system message mid-session and reset history
  - `/stats` — show session token totals
  - `/exit` or `/quit` — leave (Esc also exits when idle)
- **Per-turn stats** — TTFT, tokens/sec, and tokens generated displayed below each assistant reply.
- **Hardware controls** — same `--preset`, `--threads`, `--gpu-layers`, `--ctx-size`, `--batch-size`, `--cpu-only`, `--max-tokens`, `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--seed` flags as `nanotune benchmark`.
- **Override system prompt** — `--system` flag overrides the project's `contextMessage` for the session.

### Internals
- Extracted `findLatestGGUF()` into `src/lib/config.ts`; `benchmark` and `chat` both consume it.
- Server lifecycle reuses the SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation from 1.4.0, so a hung llama-server can't keep the REPL alive after exit.
- `process.on('exit')` backstop SIGKILLs the child on abrupt terminations (Ctrl-C, signal kills) that bypass the React unmount.

## Test Coverage

Backfilled direct unit tests for several pure-function helpers that were previously only exercised indirectly. **223 tests total (+92).**

### Extractions to enable testing
- `checkPass` + `normalizeText` moved from `src/commands/benchmark.tsx` to `src/lib/benchmark-match.ts`.
- `buildServerOptions`, `buildGenerateOptions`, and a new `parseSlashCommand` discriminated-union helper moved to `src/lib/chat-helpers.ts`.
- `parseChatCompletionResponse` extracted from `chatCompletion` and exported from `src/lib/llama-cpp.ts`.

### New tests
- **`parseCSV`** — 13 cases covering LF/CRLF/CR endings, quoted fields with embedded commas, escaped quotes (`""`), newlines inside quoted fields, mixed quoted/unquoted columns, empty fields, unclosed-quote-at-EOF, and trailing-newline handling. Plus an `importFromCSV` regression asserting that a row with an embedded comma round-trips.
- **`splitTrainValidation`** — same-seed reproducibility, full-permutation invariant (no drops, no duplicates), different-seeds-produce-different-splits, zero-examples, and the minimum-one-validation guarantee.
- **`checkPass`** — every match mode, plus an explicit regression that `semantic` mode no longer accepts `"ls"` as a pass for `acceptable: ["ls -la"]` (the 1.4.0 bug fix).
- **`normalizeText`** — whitespace collapse, quote canonicalization, trim.
- **`findLatestGGUF`** — missing dir, empty dir, no GGUFs, newest-by-mtime selection, and ignores non-`.gguf` siblings even when they're newer.
- **`parseChatCompletionResponse`** — content extraction, trimming, missing/empty `choices`, missing `message`, top-level `timings` mapping (rounded), `usage.completion_tokens` fallback, `timings.predicted_n` preferred over the usage fallback, and the `prompt_ms=0` edge case (pins current behaviour).
- **`parseSlashCommand`** — empty/whitespace noop, plain-text send, `/exit` `/quit` `/reset` `/clear` `/help` `/stats` aliases, `/system` with and without arg, case-insensitive command name, case-preserving argument, unknown commands surface as `unknown` rather than being prompted into the model.
- **`buildServerOptions` / `buildGenerateOptions`** — defaults, numeric flag parsing, `cpuOnly` passthrough, low/high preset application, preset wins over individual flags, unknown preset falls back, and the chat-specific 256-token default (vs benchmark's 50).

# 1.4.0

## Correctness Fixes

### Chat-template-aware inference
- **Switched benchmark inference from `/completion` to `/v1/chat/completions`** — llama-server now applies the model's chat template (ChatML, Llama-3 tags, etc.) baked into the GGUF. Training (which feeds MLX a `messages: []` array) and benchmarking now use the same wire format end-to-end. Previously, benchmarks built raw `User:/Assistant:` strings, bypassing the chat template and systematically under-reporting fine-tuned model quality.
- **`llama-server` is now started once per benchmark run** instead of once per test. Cold-starting the server (which loads a multi-GB model) per test has been collapsed to a single startup.

### Data import
- **Fixed CSV parser** — replaced a regex that broke on any field containing a comma with a proper state-machine parser. Quoted fields with embedded commas, escaped quotes (`""`), and CRLF line endings are now handled correctly.
- **JSONL/JSON imports preserve `messages` arrays verbatim** — previously, examples with ≤3 messages had their embedded system prompts silently overwritten by the project's context message. Now any imported `messages` array is preserved as-is.

### Benchmark `semantic` match mode
- **No longer accepts truncated answers** — the old `semantic` mode treated `"ls"` as a pass for `acceptable: ["ls -la"]`, inflating pass rates. The truncation behaviour is now opt-in via a new `partial` match mode.

### Train/valid split
- **Seedable Fisher-Yates shuffle** — replaced the biased `sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)` with Mulberry32 + Fisher-Yates. Pass a seed to `splitTrainValidation` for a reproducible split.

## Robustness & UX

- **CLI `--version` now reads from `package.json`** (was hardcoded to `1.0.0`).
- **`nanotune init` writes `.nanotune/.gitignore`** covering `judge.json` (API keys), `adapters/`, `models/`, and `benchmarks/` — protects users from committing keys or multi-GB binaries.
- **Upfront platform check** — non-arm64 / non-macOS systems now get a clear, actionable error before any download attempt.
- **Better `mlx-lm` install errors** — `installMLX` tries `--user` first and surfaces actionable guidance when stock macOS Python rejects pip with `externally-managed-environment`.
- **`nanotune train --resume` validates the checkpoint exists** before invoking MLX, replacing an opaque file-not-found with a clear message.
- **f16 intermediate cleanup moved to `finally`** — quantization failures no longer leak multi-GB intermediate files in `models/`.
- **Removed `console.error` in env-substitution** — was corrupting Ink TUI output when an env var was missing.
- **Removed CommonJS `require('node:fs')`** inside the ESM benchmark module.

## Cleanup

- Removed dead code: `runInference`, `parseDownloadProgress`, `runGGUFInferenceLegacy`.
- `InferenceOptions` is now a type alias for `ServerOptions & GenerateOptions` (was a duplicate interface).
- `chatCompletion` accepts an `AbortSignal` via `GenerateOptions.signal`; benchmarks pass one so a timed-out test actually cancels its in-flight `fetch` rather than letting the server keep generating into the void.
- `stopLlamaServer` escalates SIGTERM → SIGKILL after a 2s grace period so a hung server can't block the caller's `finally`.
- Updated spec files to match new behaviour. All 131 tests pass.

# 1.3.7

## Toolchain

- **Bumped to pnpm 11 and Node.js 22** — `packageManager` field pinned in `package.json` so CI and contributors stay in sync.
- **Regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml`** under pnpm 11 to fix `ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH` on frozen installs.
- **Raised `engines.node` to `>=22.0.0`** and updated CONTRIBUTING and installation docs to match.

---

# 1.3.6

- Updated documentation to match guidelines.

---

# 1.3.5

## Auto-install llama-server

- **Auto-install `llama-server` for existing users** — if the `llama-server` binary is missing from an older llama.cpp installation, benchmarks now automatically re-download llama.cpp before proceeding. No manual steps needed.

---

# 1.3.4

## Benchmark Inference Fix

- **Switched from `llama-cli` to `llama-server`** — benchmarks now spin up a temporary `llama-server` instance and use the `/completion` HTTP API instead of invoking `llama-cli` directly. This avoids the interactive conversation mode that newer llama.cpp versions enter by default, and returns structured timing data (TTFT, tokens/sec, generation time) directly from the response instead of parsing stderr.

---

# 1.3.3

## Benchmark Inference Fix

- **Fixed ENOENT error when running benchmarks** — the inference runner referenced a non-existent `llama-completion` binary. Updated to use `llama-cli`, which is the actual binary name shipped in llama.cpp releases and already provisioned by `nanotune export`.

---

# 1.3.1

## Benchmark Timing Fixes

- **Fixed tokens/sec parsing** — now matches llama.cpp's actual `llama_perf_context_print` output format instead of the old `tok/s` pattern
- **Fixed TTFT** — extracted from `prompt eval time` in llama.cpp stderr instead of estimating as 10% of total time
- **Fixed generation time and token count** — parsed from `eval time` stderr line
- **Added `--verbose` flag** to llama-cli invocation to ensure timing output is always emitted
- **Added summary averages** — benchmark results now include `avgTokensPerSecond` and `avgTtftMs` in the summary, displayed in both the terminal UI and markdown reports
- **Backward compatible** — old `tok/s` and `tokens generated` patterns kept as fallback for older llama.cpp versions

---

# 1.3.0

## Multi-Turn Training & Benchmarking

Nanotune now supports multi-turn conversations in both training data and benchmarks, enabling fine-tuning for dialogue and multi-step interactions.

### Multi-Turn Training
- **`nanotune data add`** supports building multi-turn examples interactively — add as many user/assistant exchanges as needed per example
- **Import** preserves multi-turn conversations from JSONL and JSON sources (4+ messages kept as-is)
- **`nanotune data list`** shows turn count per example
- **Validation** warns on consecutive same-role messages (broken alternation)

### Multi-Turn Benchmarking
- **Benchmark tests** accept a `messages` array as an alternative to `prompt` for multi-turn evaluation
- **LLM judge** receives full conversation context when evaluating multi-turn tests
- **Reports** label multi-turn tests with turn count for clarity

### Model Download Progress
- **`nanotune train`** now shows download progress when fetching a model for the first time, with percentage, file size, and elapsed time
- Downloads are tracked by polling the HuggingFace cache directory, avoiding tqdm/pipe issues

### Improved Benchmark Presets
- **`maxTokens`** values updated to sensible defaults: `low` 128, `medium` 256, `high` 512, `ultra` 1024 (previously 50–200, which was too small for meaningful responses)

---

# 1.2.1

## Bug Fix

- **Benchmark command** now works with minimal config files from external tools. Previously, `nanotune benchmark` required a full project config (with `name`, `baseModel`, `training`, `export` fields). Now it gracefully falls back to an empty context message when the config doesn't match the full schema, enabling benchmark-only workflows.

---

# 1.2.0

## Message-Structure-Agnostic Training

Nanotune is no longer locked into the `system/user/assistant` message structure. The hardcoded `systemPrompt` config field has been replaced with a flexible `contextMessage` that accepts any role (`system`, `developer`, or custom roles).

### What Changed
- **`nanotune init`** now asks for a context message role (defaulting to `system`) and content, instead of just a system prompt
- **Config format** uses `contextMessage: { role, content }` instead of `systemPrompt`
- **Validation** is relaxed: training examples require at least 2 messages with any role names, instead of exactly 3 with hardcoded roles
- **Backward compatible**: existing projects using `systemPrompt` in config.json continue to work without changes

### Why
Models like FunctionGemma use a `developer` role instead of `system`. This change lets you fine-tune for any chat message structure.
